        TODO

2. Send any JSON payload with following data to subscribing a channel:

> Note: This is only demo deployment with a lot checks turned off. It is running at low cost server (1$ per month). **But it handles nearly 500 concurent users :sunglasses:.**

# Why use it?

- performance in the first place
- no need for 3rd party provider
- securely operated on your own servers
- don't mess up with WebSocket implementation
- scalable solution using Docker
- did we mention performance?

# What will you get?

- source code
- licence for comercial usage and modification
- documentation how to build, deploy and run the server
- consultations about your own changes
- streaming API for the public data (private section is in development)
