There is a simple demo of our implementation:

1. Connect to the WebSocket at

        TODO

2. Send any JSON payload with following data to subscribing a channel:

    <!-- language: lang-json -->
    
        {"event":"addChannel", "channel":"CHANNEL_NAME"}

3. Then send data to the REST endpoint:

        TODO

> Note: This is only demo deployment with a lot checks turned off. It is running on low cost server. **But it handles more than [5000 concurent](performance.md) users.**
