# Performance

This is the load test of Bitsocket running on low cost (1$ per month) virtual server with following configuration:

- VMware hypervisor
- CPU 1vCore
- RAM 1GB

## Results

### Latency per clients
First test distributed 1 message per second. Connected clients has been increased by 100 every two minutes. Following graph shows latency for connected clients.

If we send 2 messages per second, distribution is working nearly same until 3000 clients. This is the cap for given server configuration.
